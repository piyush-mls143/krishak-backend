## API Documentation
1)
router.post('/admin/update_forum')
This routes works when the post function is called on url(‘/admin/update_form’), it search the received id from the post data as _id and finds out the forum detail by comparing post _id to table’s id and updates in the respective id. If the data is updated successfully then it sends Success message “Forum Edited Successfully!’ as a json. 



2)
router.post('/admin/delete_forum')
This router works by getting the id of post(forum) from the user and it finds the id of that post in the database, if it finds the id in the database then it deletes record of the post in the database. And in the response it sends forum deleted successfully in json.


3)
